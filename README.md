	   Make sure you uncheck the last 3 evolutionary forces

	   You can pipe your output to EVOLVE/output/test.csv
	   You can open test.csv with your favorite spreadsheet editor
	   It is not in a graph-friendly format yet, we will have to write a new quickWrite() for that

	   lmk if there are issues
